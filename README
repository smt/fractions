fractions
=========

Adds a 'to_fraction' method to Float, e.g., (0.5).to_fraction => [1,2].

Originally a snippet by Michelle/shell (http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/3636), now ported to a Rails plugin.

I've also prepared a simple helper module that mixes a 'nice_fraction' method into ActionView::Base.
